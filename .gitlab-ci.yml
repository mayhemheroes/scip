# This file is the root of the gitlab ci pipeline.
# It sets pipeline variables such as the versions of the dependencies and the name of the docker image.
# It also defines the stages of the pipeline and includes the ci snippets for each stage.
# The ci snippets are located in the ci folder.
# Jobs should not be defined in this file but in their own file in the ci folder.
# Similar jobs should be grouped in the same file and use inheritance to avoid code duplication.
# The image custom image used in this pipeline is quite complex and large as it contains all the dependencies of SCIP.
# It is defined in ci/docker/Dockerfile.
# The image is built in the first stage of the pipeline and then used in all the other stages.
# Jobs that do not require the dependecies inside the image should run on a smaller image like debian-slim.
